This application accepts 2 random strings and checks whether they are anagrams. I was using MVC pattern for creating architecture of program. If those strings have different length they canâ€™t be anagrams and an custom exception is thrown. The result of the program is printing to console, but it also can test the code automatically using Junit tests.
